# Code for exploring postprocessing effects on high frequency global land cover maps for change assessment

The `src` directory contains all of the code used in the paper.
The subdirectories and files are numbered in the order of processing.

To make use of input data, you need to create a `data` directory and add the necessary raw data files into the subdirectory `raw`.
See individual processing files for the exact filenames.
The files can be obtained on request from IIASA and WUR.

Similarly, you might need to create an `output` directory for storing output figures.
